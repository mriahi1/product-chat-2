This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Contributing
Fork the Project:

What is it? : A fork is a copy of a repository on GitHub, created under the user's GitHub account rather than the original project account.

Why do it? : Forking is commonly used to contribute to an open-source project. By forking a project, you can make changes to your personal copy without affecting the original project. Once you have made changes and are satisfied, you can propose these changes to the original project via a Pull Request.

Git Branches:

What are they? : Branches are independent lines of development created from a main branch. They allow isolating work in progress from the rest of the code.

Why use them? : Branches are useful for working on features or fixes without directly affecting the main branch (usually main or master). This enables multiple developers to work simultaneously on different features.

Pull Request:

What is it? : A Pull Request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch into another (typically from a feature branch into the main branch).

Why make one? : When you have finished working on a feature in a branch, you create a PR to suggest that these changes be merged into the main branch. This allows project owners to review your changes before merging.
